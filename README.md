Collect all the things! Vanilla Minecraft 1.13 scavenger hunt. Collect all items obtainable in survival.

Wholly inspired by lorgon111's "Quest for every item!" Exploration and Tactics series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X85Lc7-aBXY&list=PLHYAYMSbpcvsqOj88Bu_O0eVjVEH-7Y2F), I've created a similar minigame for Minecraft 1.13.

To get started, load into a new world, and start collecting items. As you collect new items, you'll see messages like: "All the things: You just discovered Oak Planks!"

To display your progress in a bossbar, just drop a written book. You will then receive a special book that lists all the items in the quest, and displays your progress visually as a bossbar.

The command functions were mostly auto-generated by another program I wrote, to avoid copypasta errors (and because I'm aggressively lazy like that). I have the test for new items only running once per second to help avoid lag. I can't figure out how to use a scoreboard value to toggle between different texts, so right now if you have already collected an item, you'll see the number "2" beside it in the quest book.

Enjoy!
